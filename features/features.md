# Features Supported by RARS

//include RARS logo

RARS is a PDF viewer built in Flutter. Unlike a normal PDF viewer, RARS supports switching tabs so that the user can read multiple books without switching windows again and again. 

## Current features :  
- Mutiple PDFs support: The user can read multiple PDFs at one time without changing windows. Just open the PDFs and click on the tab of the PDF you want to read.

- Multiple Bookmarks addition: It also provides support to add multiple bookmarks so you can always switch to the part of the pdf which you found interesting. Oh, and this doesn't have any limit. Add as many bookmarks as you like. Maybe bookmark every page of the PDF and it will be saved in a scrollable bookmark bar.

- Retaining the last page read: Whenever you open a book, you will get an option to "start from where you left off" or "start from the beginning". If it's a PDF you recently added on your shelf of PDFs, then it will start from the beginning, till u leave it off!
